## Research Experience


<!-- Project 1 -->
* <strong>Discharge Decision-making in Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR) System with Heterogeneous Patient Adherence Pattern</strong><br>
  Supervised by <a href="https://ioe.engin.umich.edu/people/lavieri-mariel/">Prof. Mariel Lavieri</a> | UMich
  * Collaborated with Michigan Medicine clinicians to understand current clinical workflows, discharge practices, and patient flow constraints in CR settings.<br>
  * Conducted literature review on cardiac rehabilitation operations, adherence prediction, and patient flow optimization problems to understand problem challenges and research gaps.<br>
  * Defined key research objectives, including modeling patient adherence, predicting dropouts, and optimizing discharge timing to optimize patient admission and discharge decisions in CR centers under uncertainty.<br>

<!-- Project 2 -->
* <strong>Center-Level Variation in the Use of HCV+ Livers: Implications for Waitlist and Post-Transplant Outcomes</strong><br>
  Supervised by <a href="https://ioe.engin.umich.edu/people/lavieri-mariel/">Prof. Mariel Lavieri</a> | UMich
  * Investigated the impact of listing for hepatitis C virus-positive (HCV+) liver organs on transplant access and outcomes using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, Cox proportional hazard models, and Fine-Gray competing risks models based on national UNOS registry data from 2015–2023.<br>
  * Identified demographic and clinical differences between candidates listed for HCV+ vs. HCV– organs (e.g., liver disease etiology, insurance status, and ethnicity).<br>
  * Analyzed center-level variability in HCV+ organ use and HCV+ organ listing, accounting for transplant volume and deceased cardiac donor (DCD) utilization rates.<br>

<!-- Project 3 -->
* <strong>Synchronizing the Treatment of Multiple Chronic Conditions Based on Maximum Safe Treatment Intervals</strong><br>
  Supervised by <a href="https://ioe.engin.umich.edu/people/lavieri-mariel/">Prof. Mariel Lavieri</a> | UMich
  * Conducted a literature review on the synchronization of treatment scheduling, treat-and-extend policy, and maximum safe treatment interval (MSTI) for chronic conditions.<br>
  * Conducted 10-year simulations under three treatment policies (π₁, π₂, πᵢ) to quantify overtreatment risk relative to clinic visit reductions in chronic conditions treatment.<br>
  * Defined and implemented the Extra Injections per Saved Visit (EISV) index to identify MSTI patterns where synchronization policies yield minimal overtreatment and maximal visit reductions.<br>
  * Provided clinical decision-making suggestions based on simulated policy performance across 45 MSTI combinations.<br>




* **Parameters Estimation and Global Sensitivity Analysis of Time-Varying SEIRD Compartmental Model Based on State-level Covid-19 Data in the U.S.**<br>
  Supervised by <a href="https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Hall/Randolph">Prof. Randolph Hall</a> | USC
  * Fitted 8 parameters (4 shape parameters of 2 sigmoid functions) for each state using Covid-19 case and death data to an extended SEIRD model in which transmission rate and fatality rate changing chronologically, with the model reaching RRMSEs of 1.54% for cases and 1.20% for deaths.<br>
  * Conducted sensitivity analysis with a self-developed Monte Carlo simulation algorithm and investigated scenarios of 8 parameters following uniform, normal, lognormal, gamma, and truncated normal distribution, inspecting 245 days in California and New York State starting from March 13, 2020.<br>
  * Established country-level sensitivity analysis with 410 parameters for the SERID model considering the transportation effect between states on COVID-19 transmission among all 50 states.<br>
