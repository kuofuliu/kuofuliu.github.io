I am interested in machine learning, mathematical modeling, stochastic programming, and optimization. My current research application focuses on healthcare, but I am open to other fields and interdisciplinary opportunities.

**Familiar Methodologies**

Clustering & Classification Algorithms: K-prototypes, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, etc

Survival Analysis

Time Series Analysis: ARIMA, LSTM

Disease Transmission Model (PDE)

Vaccine Allocation (Optimization)

**What I am doing:**

Pandemic Modeling: Gravity Model, SEIR Compartment Model

Multi-stage Stochastic Programming in Closed Loop Supply Chain.
