My career goal is to pursue research at the intersection of healthcare systems, machine learning, and optimization. Throughout my postgraduate study, my primary objective is to apply my expertise in machine learning and mathematical modeling to bring progress to health systems worldwide. Acknowledging the common issue of underutilizing findings in practical applications, I am dedicated to implementing research-based solutions in real-world scenarios. 

**Familiar Methodologies**

Clustering & Classification Algorithms: K-prototypes, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, etc

Survival Analysis

Time Series Analysis: ARIMA, LSTM

Disease Transmission Model

Vaccine Allocation

**What I am doing:**

Pandemic Modeling: Gravity Model, SEIR Compartment Model

Multi-stage Stochastic Programming.
